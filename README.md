# Magazine Layout
Using Photoshop, I created a mockup of a magazine layout for Gay Times for their Pride Month issue! 

I created wireframes to help me map out how I wanted the layout to look like 

and I decided I wanted to use cards to showcase their pride articles. 

# Canyon Hikers Case Study
Canyon Hikers is a tour guide company that gives tours of the Grand Canyon. 

They wanted their website to showcase the beautfuil wonders of the Grand Canyon to 

bring more tourism to the area. I created a style guide, and decided on what the color palette would be 

and what the nav bar, footer, buttons and their logo would look like.



# Responsive-Layout
This is an example of a website that responds when its size changes!
